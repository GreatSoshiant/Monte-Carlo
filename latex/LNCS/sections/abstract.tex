\begin{abstract}
A number of Ethereum projects for stablecoins and synthetic assets use a similar mechanism for establishing an asset with a fixed price that is backed by a cryptocurrency that is volatile in price. In this paper, we isolate this shared mechanism---which we call the red-black coin primitive---and we study the core primitive itself. We use a model to demonstrate its financial characteristics and reason about how it should be priced. Real world projects do not use the red-black coin primitive in isolation but layer other stability mechanisms and features on top of it. We develop a design landscape for extending red-black coins to showcase the many alternatives for achieving fungibility, liquidation, and other functionalities.
