\begin{abstract}
A number of Ethereum projects for stablecoins and synthetic assets use the same core mechanism for fixing the price of an asset. In this paper, we distil this shared approach into a primitive we call red-black coins. We use a model to demonstrate the primitive's financial characteristics and to reason about how it should be priced. Real world projects do not use the red-black coin primitive in isolation but layer on other mechanisms and features. We develop a design landscape for extending the red-black coin primitive with features like fungibility and reduced exposure to price drops.
